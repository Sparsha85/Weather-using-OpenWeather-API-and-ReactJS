# Weather-using-OpenWeather-API-and-ReactJS
As a practice project, I made a program that fetches the weather using Openweather API. This was just for practice and hence the styling is terrible. ðŸ˜©

Due to upload constraints in Github, I have uploaded only the files to be used under the src folder. Please use create-react-app to get the remaining files. 
After that replace all the files in src with the files uploaded here.
